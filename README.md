# Face Cropper

A very simple tool that automatically crops the faces from pictures in designated directory. Implemented with Dlib.

Install dlib, OpenCV and numpy before use. C++ is required and you probably need Visual Studio for installation if you are running on Windows.

shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat is required for face landmark detection. The file is attached with this repo so please download it.
